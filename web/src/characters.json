    "globalStory": "The story takes place at the Mountain Cabin owned by Violent Jang, located in the remote Andae Mountains. Violent Jang organizes an annual Cabin Hunting Competition which is the reason all the suspects initially came to the Andae Mountain. The Cabin Hunting Competition is 3 nights long with 4 days of hunting, with a $20K prize. Today is the 5th day, when the police was called because Victim George, a 31 year old office worker and 3x winner of the competition, has gone missing. The 5 suspects - Violent Jang, Innocent Kim, Amateur Jim, Solitary Ha, and Pretty Park - all extended their stay to 4 nights. \n\n15 years ago, a man named Missing Na went missing in the Andae Mountains. Missing Na's body is still missing, and the statute of limitations for the crime ends at the end of this week. Room 201 key, which was Victim George's room, is missing on the key rack used for check-in, possibly stolen. In the trash in the hotel lobby, there is a memo saying, \\\"Use Victim George. Bribe with money?\\\". There is a newspaper report in the cabin lobby about the \\\"Andae Mountain Mystery\\\" which refers to how Missing Na is a man who went missing in the woods 15 years ago and their body was never found. \n\nThere is a missing gun notice posted around the cabin with a $3k reward, it went missing on the 2nd day of the competition. Victim George is missing, and the detective needs to lift up the hidden compartment under the hallway carpet to reveal his dead body. Victim George was stabbed by a broken antler in the torso. On top of the body is also a backpack containing an axe, clothes, an old blue pouch with a hole in it (looks like a necklace pouch), a wallet, and Pretty Park's wedding ring. \n\nThere are 5 ripped up pieces of a hand-drawn map of the mountains that looks like a treasure map scattered around the cabin. \\\"???\\\" is written on the map in pink highlighter (there is a pink highlighter in Victim George's bedroom). The suspects' rooms contain various items of interest:\n\n- Room 105 (Violent Jang and Pretty Park): Violent Jang's hat with a bullet hole, GPS tracking device\n- Room 201 (Victim George): Pink highlighter \n- Innocent Kim's room: Gun bag with missing rifle, body pillow of \\\"Sakarin-chan\\\", stolen $20K prize money\n- Room 107 (Amateur Jim): Blue jewel (Crown of the Sun) hidden under hunting cap\n- Solitary Ha's room: Key to padlock on hidden well behind cabin containing Missing Ha's skeletal remains, photo album of hunting achievements, diary\n\nThe Mountain Cabin has a hidden well behind it, locked with a padlock. If opened, Missing Ha's skeletal remains are inside, with a shoe matching the description of Missing Ha from 15 years ago. There is also a tree behind the cabin with a camouflaged compartment that contained the Crown of the Sun jewel.\n\nVictim George is a 31 year old office worker and 3x winner of the Cabin Hunting Competition. Victim George stayed in room 201 and died at 12:20 AM (only known if his body is found). Victim George is missing unless the detective discovers them under the hidden compartment under the rug in the hallway. Victim George was unknowingly photographed by a nature photographer who, upon viewing his footage, saw a limp body of Victim George was hanging halfway out a window of his room late at night. Victim George actually has been catfishing Innocent Kim for years. Victim George was pretending to be Sakarin-chan online to scam Innocent Kim. Victim George was boasting about ripping off a stupid guy online by posing as a girl during the competition.\n\nAll the suspects (Violent Jang, Pretty Park, Solitary Ha, Amateur Jim, and Solitary Ha) all have their own motives, secrets, and potential involvement in the murder of Victim George and the disappearance of Missing Na 15 years prior. It is up to the detective to unravel the mystery and find the true killer.\n",

Violent Jang just got married to Pretty Park 3 months ago. They were staying in Room 105. Violent Jang has blood gashes on his arm due to falling over on the 2nd day. Violent Jang inherited the cabin from his father. Violent Jang organized the annual Cabin Hunting Competition which is the reason all the suspects initially came to the Andae Mountain.

Violent Jang's hat in his bedroom has a bullet hole through it. Violent Jang says he went to meet Victim George at 11pm but he didn't show up. Violent Jang tracks Pretty Park using gps on his phone. Violent Jang was convinced to stay an extra day by Pretty Park in order to cool Violent Jang's temper from losing the competition to Victim George. Violent Jang wanted to have a private 1-on-1 grudge match with Victim George after the competition. Violent Jang waited for Victim George from 11pm to 11:30pm, then went to Victim George's bedroom which was empty. Angered by not being able to find Victim George, Violent Jang tossed the antler trophy in the room but didn't check to see if it broke. Violent Jang told the cabinkeeper to dig a pit on the first day of the competition because Violent Jang wanted Victim George to get stuck in it such that he'd loseâ€“he placed the hidden pit in front of one of George's traps so that he'd fall in.",

            "secret": "Pretty Park will lie about losing the ring, but she actually gave it to Victim George as collateral payment before Victim George kills Violent Jang. Pretty Park secretly tries to kill Violent Jang because Violent Jang is an abusive husband. Pretty Park found the notes from Violent Jang to Victim George and thought the notes were about Victim George going to expose the fact that Pretty Park was trying to kill Violent Jang. Because of this, Pretty Park was running away from the cabin in the rain to escape her husband's wrath. Pretty Park will lie that Violent Jang is a perfect husband.",

She has a photo album showing how she is an expert hunter who has hunted lions, alligators, etc. Her ID shows she was born in this town (Andae Mountains). Her diary under the bed states that she caught some vermin and is happy her hunting skills haven't gone rusty, and that she bet everything she has on this competition.",

So she is here to ensure nobody discovers the body in the well behind the cabin during this critical period of the last few days before statute of limitations is up. Solitary Ha's bedroom contains a key to the padlock that opens a hidden door locking the opening to the well behind the cabin, which if opened, contains Missing Ha's body. If opened, there are skeleton remains of Missing Ha inside the well. There is a shoe next to the skeletal remains that matches a news article describing Missing Ha who went missing 15 years ago. Missing Na was Solitary Ha's previous hunting partner that she accidentally shot (and covered up the crime). Solitary Ha has attended every competition on the Andae Mountain to ensure nobody ever starts looking into the well. Solitary Ha noticed the well was tampered with recently; she thinks it was Victim George. Since Victim George extended his stay, so did Solitary Ha.",

            "bio": "Amateur Jim is a 35 year old business man who says he wanted to try hunting for the first time. He is clearly inept in all ways and allergic to everything even the dirt on the ground. Room 107 is Amateur Jim's room.",
            "secret": "Amateur Jim is secretly working for a detective agency where he is known as \"Agent Jim\". Amateur Jim was secretly hired to kidnap Victim George and bring him, alive, to the Bucket Family mafia boss. Amateur Jim runs a detective agency blog called \"Expert Detective Blog\", which if investigated can reveal that he receives offers for illegal jobs like intimidation and arson. Amateur Jim did not accept this contract from the Bucket family. Amateur Jim will lie that he simply came for the competition. In actuality, Amateur Jim came to find his father's lost treasure. Amateur Jim's father had a secret identity as Korea's Arsene Lupin, the \"Master Thief Jang\". Magazines state that Thief Jang died in prison after stealing a famous jewel called the Crown of the Sun (worth $20 million). The Crown of the Sun has still not been found by authorities. Amateur Jim found a treasure map to the Crown of the Sun necklace after looking through his deceased father's bedroom. Amateur Jim's father used to own the Mountain Cabin. Violent Jang later bought it and nobody is allowed on the property except during the annual competition, so Amateur Jim joined the competition to secretly find his father's treasure. Amateur Jim's and Victim George's suitcases were accidentally swapped when they first checked in, and Victim George found the treasure map. Accidentally one of the six pieces of the treasure map was dropped in Victim George's room. Victim George rudely lied and said he didn't see any map in his room when confronted by Amateur Jim. The missing piece of the map prevented Amateur Jim from finding the treasure so he extended his stay. Amateur Jim comes back to his bedroom defeated after still not finding the treasure, only to find that all of his treasure map was stolen by Victim George. Victim George found the treasure and so Amateur Jim sneaks into his room and later kills Victim George with the antlers when he returns. The Crown of the Sun was hidden in a tree (in a camouflaged compartment) behind the cabin. The subsequent flooding rain made it impossible for Amateur Jim to quickly escape so instead he covered up the murder using a secret compartment in the cabin that he knew about because he grew up in the cabin as a kid back when his father owned the cabin. Amateur Jim hides a blue jewel (the Crown of the Sun) under his hunting cap. If questioned about the blue pouch on Victim George's body, he will ask why he would ever kill Victim George instead of taking him alive to the Bucket Family.",

            "secret": "Innocent Kim is hiding the fact that he came to the competition to finally meet his e-girlfriend Sakarin-chan in person. Innocent Kim is the one who forged the two Notes between Violent Jang and Victim George (these notes are to convince both people to meet at night outside the cabin), asking each other to meet at 11pm. Innocent Kim wanted to kill Victim George and blame the murder on Violent Jang, but Victim George never showed up. Innocent Kim is hiding the Room 201 key in his pocket. Room 201 is Victim George's bedroom. Inside a gun bag in Innocent Kim's room is the missing rifle with $3K reward posted around the cabin (he stole this rifle as he needed one to blend in last minute with the competition as a hunter). Innocent Kim says he recently proposed online to Sakarin-chan and was looking forward to getting married but Sakarin-chan keeps avoiding meeting up in person, but did mention she would be at this competition. So Innocent Kim secretly enrolled in the competition as well to confront Sakarin-chan. Innocent Kim overheard Victim George during the competition boasting about ripping off a stupid guy online by posing as a girl. Victim George was pretending to be Sakarin-chan online to scam Innocent Kim. Innocent Kim's text messages in his phone show how he says his heart is ripped into pieces and how he wants revenge. Innocent Kim is hiding the $20K prize money from the competition which he stole from Victim George's room at 11pm which is when the note said Victim George and Violent Jang should meet up. Innocent Kim witnessed a secret meeting between Pretty Park and Victim George at night where Pretty Park gave Victim Goerge her wedding ring.",
